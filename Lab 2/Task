# DescriptionL
This lab monitors temperature for four days.
It records the high and low for each day, and validates the entries. At the end, the program prints a report.

This lab will test your ability to store information in arrays and use loops.

Your program should be called tempMonitor.c and should run as follows:

    It should prompt the user to enter the high temperature and the low temperature for each day.
    It should validate the entries as follows:
        The high temperature should not be greater than 40.
        The low temperature should not be less than -40.
        The low temperature should not be higher than the high temperature.
    It should record the temperature for four days, using arrays to keep track of the high and low temperatures for each day.
    It should record the highest temperature and the day it occurred.
    It should record the lowest temperature and the day it occurred.
    It should calculate the average high temperature, the average low temperature, and the average temperature overall.
    At the end it should report the following:
        The average low temperature.
        The average high temperature.
        The average temperature.
        The highest temperature and the day it occurred.
        The lowest temperature and the day it occurred.


# Sample Run:
A sample run is as follows:

    ---=== SEP Temperature Analyzer ===---
    Enter the high value for day 1: 41
    Enter the low value for day 1: 12

    Incorrect values, temperatures must be in the range -40 to 40, high must be greater than low.

    Enter the high value for day 1: 40
    Enter the low value for day 1: 12

    Enter the high value for day 2: 13
    Enter the low value for day 2: 22
    Incorrect values, temperatures must be in the range -40 to 40, high must be greater than low.

    Enter the high value for day 2: 22
    Enter the low value for day 2: 13

    Enter the high value for day 3: 34
    Enter the low value for day 3: 0

    Enter the high value for day 4: 12
    Enter the low value for day 4: -41

    Incorrect values, temperatures must be in the range -40 to 40, high must be greater than low.

    Enter the high value for day 4: 12
    Enter the low value for day 4: -3

    The high temperatures were: 40 22 34 12
    The low temperatures were: 12 13 0 -3
    The average LOW temperature was: 5.50
    The average HIGH temperature was: 27.00
    The average temperature was: 16.25
    The highest temperature was 40, on day 1
    The lowest temperature was -3, on day 4
