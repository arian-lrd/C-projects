# Description:
This lab simulates a cash register. The user is prompted for the cost of 3 items. The cash register calculates the total.
The cash register then gives a report as to how many dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies are required.
This lab will test your ability to retrieve information, perform calculations, and prepare a report.
Your program should be called cashRegister.c and should run as follows:

    Cash Register

    Enter the cost of item 1: $<cost_item1>
    Enter the cost of item 2: $<cost_item2>
    Enter the cost of item 3: $<cost_item3>

    The total cost is $<total_cost>

    Cash Register

    Enter the cost of item 1: $12.50
    Enter the cost of item 2: $13.25
    Enter the cost of item 3: $5.17

    The total cost is $30.92

    You used 30 dollars, 3 quarters, 1 dimes, 1 nickels and 2 pennies.
